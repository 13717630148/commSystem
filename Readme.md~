## Source Rep for Course Projects

The course projects of *"Communication System"* and the *"Communication and Network"* are stored in this rep.

They are relatively finished by Tingwu Wang in the Spring semester of the 2014 and the Autumn semester of 2015. 

All the codes are free for you to use after you inform me.

## Special Reminder

The source codes of the projects are only poorly written. 
And any possible consequences like an accuse of plagiarism by the course teacher will only be your problem,
as I hereby release the code only for reference and learning purposes, and no one should copy this work for homework usage.

## Current progress

The first homework of the *"Communication and Network"*
